You will need to perform three major checks on your website.

First, check to see whether your site has an SSL certificate or not. You'll also need to know if your website is using a self-signed SSL certificate which is not considered a valid certificate (it needs to be signed by a certificate authority).
Second, to see if the SSL certificate has the correct hostname.
And third, you need to know the expiration date of the server certificate.

Step 1: Check if your website has an SSL certificate
Step 2: Check whether the SSL certificate and website hostname match
Step 3: Verify the expiration date of the server's SSL certificate
